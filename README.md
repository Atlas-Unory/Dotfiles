# 🎩 Hello stranger
This are my personal dotfiles (at least some of them) for a development environment and for a good-looking desktop. You ca use both of them at the same time if you wish, or you can just chose one of them that you'd like to use and installed it.

## ⚙️ Development Environment
Since I can't know what kind of project you work with, you may have to edit the  `Intall_Dev_Script.sh` to add or remove something that you might need in your workflow.

## ✨ Customizing Desktop

## 🗚  More fonts
There are some fonts that I didn't got in the script, so here they are.

Adobe source sans serif and sans fonts and CJK and emoji which cover most of Asia characters.

```bash
    sudo pacman -S sudo adobe-source-han-serif-cn-fonts adobe-source-han-serif-jp-fonts adobe-source-han-serif-kr-fonts adobe-source-han-serif-otc-fonts adobe-source-han-serif-tw-fonts
```

```bash
    sudo pacman -S adobe-source-han-sans-cn-fonts adobe-source-han-sans-jp-fonts adobe-source-han-sans-kr-fonts adobe-source-han-sans-otc-fonts adobe-source-han-sans-tw-fonts
```

Fonts to display icons and emojis correctly

```bash
    sudo pacman -S noto-fonts-cjk noto-fonts-emoji noto-fonts-extra
```
