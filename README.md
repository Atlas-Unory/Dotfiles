# 🎩 Hello Stranger
This are my personal dotfiles (at least some of them) for a development environment and for a good-looking desktop. You ca use both of them at the same time if you wish, or you can just chose one of them that you'd like to use and installed it.

## ⚙️ Development Environment
⚠️**I only work with Linux**

### About the dotfiles
All my dotfiles were made to work on Linux, specifically on Arch Linux and its distributions. In case you aren't on one of these distributions, my dotfiles won't work natively 100% right off the bat. For them all to work, you'll have to manually verify which of the packages are available on your Linux distribution.
If you are an Arch Linux user or are currently using one of its distributions, I don't have a `Install` script yet, but I will add one in the future, but I don't know when, I just know it won't be soon since I'm busy now.

## ✨ Customizing Desktop

### 🗚  More fonts
Here are some fonts I think you should install on your system.

Adobe source sans serif and sans fonts and CJK and emoji which cover most of Asia characters.
```bash
    sudo pacman -S sudo adobe-source-han-serif-cn-fonts adobe-source-han-serif-jp-fonts adobe-source-han-serif-kr-fonts adobe-source-han-serif-otc-fonts adobe-source-han-serif-tw-fonts
```

```bash
    sudo pacman -S adobe-source-han-sans-cn-fonts adobe-source-han-sans-jp-fonts adobe-source-han-sans-kr-fonts adobe-source-han-sans-otc-fonts adobe-source-han-sans-tw-fonts
```
