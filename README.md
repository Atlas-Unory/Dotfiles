# 🎩 Hellow stranger
This are my personal dotfiles (atleast some of them) for a development envaroment and for a good-looking desktop. You ca use both of them at the same time if you wish, or you can just chose one of them that you'd like to use and installe it.

## ⚙️ Development Envaroment
Since I can't know what kind of project you work with, you may have to edit the  `Intall_Dev_Script.sh` to add or remove something that you might need in your workflow.

There are some fonts that I didn't got in the script, so here they are.
